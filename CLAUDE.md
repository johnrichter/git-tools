# git-tools

> **Purpose:** Small, focused command-line tools for working with git. (confirm/refine)

One of the sibling repos under `psa-platform`. Worked on directly — not through the PSA `workspace`. Outside `workspace`, Claude has no PSA identity; only the general conventions below apply.

## Conventions come from plugins, not this file

Authoring & output style, the frontmatter + tagging schema, git governance, code-authoring standards, model tiering, and writing voice are all provided by the enabled Claude Code plugins (`.claude/settings.json`). The `framework-conventions` plugin injects the full convention set every session via its SessionStart hook — never restate or `@import` it here.

## Workspace boundary

This repo root is the working boundary. Don't create, modify, or delete files outside it unless explicitly instructed.

## Projects

Project work lives in `.projects/<slug>/` at the repo root, tracked in git so `delivery-agent-team` (build-with-team) can plan, build, and resume in-repo. Keep projects short-lived: complete, cut a release, then prune.

## Discovery

`navigator` is enabled for frontmatter/tag-aware discovery over this repo and its `additionalDirectories` — prefer it over raw grep/glob. Vocabulary config lives in `navigator.toml`.
