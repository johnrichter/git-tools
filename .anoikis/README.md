# .anoikis — anoikis plans & builds

Home for anoikis-based planning and builds — one directory per effort (`.anoikis/<slug>/`).

- **Tracked in git.** Plans and builds are committed so work can resume and hand off across sessions.
- **Short-lived.** Complete, cut a release, consume downstream, then prune the effort directory.
- **Successor to `.pbwt/`.** Reserved now; new efforts adopt this directory once anoikis takes over from plan/build-with-team.
